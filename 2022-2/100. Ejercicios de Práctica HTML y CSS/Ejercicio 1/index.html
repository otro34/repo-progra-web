            Another day, then another night, and the fish is still dragging the old man’s boat far away on the ocean… Yet the old man doesn’t give up, 
            although he hardly has anything to eat or drink and he suffers from cramps, back ache and exhaustion. He even believes he might just die there, 
            alone in his skiff. But eventually, the fish starts to swim closer to the surface of the water and, after a very long struggle,  
            the old man manages to catch it and kill it.  However, it’s so long that he can’t load it in the skiff so he decides to fix it along the boat. 
            He then starts to sail back to the shore…

            They sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep his head clear. There were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that the old man knew the breeze would last all night. 
            The old man looked at the fish constantly to make sure it was true.  It was an hour before the first shark hit him.
